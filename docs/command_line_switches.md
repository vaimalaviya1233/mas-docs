## Uses In Powershell One Liner

`& ([ScriptBlock]::Create((irm https://get.activated.win))) /para`

-   Replace `/para` in this command with the switches from the above table. You can also use multiple switches. For example, `/HWID /Ohook`
-   This Powershell one-liner will work on Windows 8.1 and later versions only.
-   Make sure to use the below command beforehand to enable TLs1.2 on older Windows versions.  
`[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol=[Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12`
-   To change the edition through the command line, check [here](change_windows_edition.md#manual-edition-change). We didn't automate it in MAS because it requires a reboot in some cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Rules

-   Script will run in unattended mode if any switch is used.
-   `/S` switch is not applicable in MAS separate files version scripts.
-   All switches are case-insensitive, and work in any order, but must be separated with spaces.
-   KMS Uninstall switch will take precedence over other KMS switches.
-   KMS38 remove protection switch will take precedence over KMS38 activation.

# Licensing Servers Issue

-   In some cases, **HWID activation** may fail because the system couldn't connect to HWID licensing servers.
-   The activation script will inform you about this if that is the case. We suggest following the below guide only when the script tells you to do so.

## Network Reset

-   In Windows 10/11, go to settings and search for Network Reset, then apply this option.
-   Restart your system and try HWID Activation.
-   If it's showing the same Internet error then follow the below option.

## VPN

-	Download [Windscribe VPN](https://windscribe.com/download/) for Windows and install.
-	It will require you to signup, you can do that without email ID. After that, login in the app, connect, and try HWID activation.
-   If the VPN is not connecting, use another Internet connection such as your Mobile phone through USB Tethering or Wi-Fi Hotspot, and try HWID activation.
-   If HWID activation is still not working then check [here](troubleshoot.md) for help.
